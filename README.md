SSH Reverse Shell IPFire
----------------------------

This repository provides the necessary instructions and scripts to establish a secure SSH reverse shell for IPFire. This setup is particularly useful for gaining remote access to an IPFire system in scenarios where inbound connections are restricted.

Features
• Establishes a reverse shell connection via SSH.

• Designed for secure and controlled remote access.

• Compatible with IPFire installations.


Prerequisites

• An IPFire system that is installed and properly configured.

• A server with SSH enabled to accept reverse shell connections.

• Dependencies including OpenSSH and basic Linux utilities like `curl` or `wget`.

Installation

Step 1: Prepare the Server

• Ensure SSH is enabled and accessible on your server.

• Create a dedicated user for the reverse shell connection to limit permissions:
  sudo adduser ipfire_reverse
  
• Generate SSH keys on the server if not already done:
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  
Step 2: Configure IPFire
• Log into your IPFire system.

• Download the reverse shell script from this repository:

  curl -O <repository_url>/reverse_shell.sh
  

Step 3: Setup SSH Keys

• Copy the public key from your server to the IPFire system:

  ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@<ipfire_ip>
  
• Ensure the script references the correct key location.


Usage
• Once the reverse shell connection is established, you can interact with the IPFire system as needed using the SSH session from the server.
• Example command:
  ssh ipfire_reverse@<server_ip>
